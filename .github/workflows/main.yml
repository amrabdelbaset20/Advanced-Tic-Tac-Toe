    # Step 1: Check out the repository code
    - name: Checkout Repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v4

        version: '6.4.0' # Using a stable Qt6 version

    # Step 3: Configure the project with CMake for Release mode
    - name: Configure CMake (Release)
      run: cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

    # Step 4: Build the project
    # The --config Release flag is crucial for Visual Studio generators
    - name: Build Project
      run: cmake --build build --config Release

    # Step 5: Run the Google Tests
    - name: Run Google Tests

    # Step 6: Create a folder for our release package

    # Step 7: Copy the main executable into the release folder
    - name: Copy Executable to Release Folder
      run: copy build\src\Release\AdvancedTicTacToe.exe release

    # Step 8: Use windeployqt to automatically find and copy Qt DLLs
    # THIS IS THE CORRECTED STEP: It uses the QT_DIR environment variable
    # provided by the install-qt-action, which is much more reliable.
